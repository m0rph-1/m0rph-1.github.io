## From 0 to OSCP In 8 Years Flat
You read that correct. Start to finish, it took me approximately 8 years to complete OSCP.
+	How could it have possibly taken that long? 
+	How many attempts did it take you? 
+	Just....what? 

I'm sure these questions (and others) may be crossing your mind as you read this, but there is a very simple explanation: military service. I first signed up for Penetration Testing With BackTrack Linux in 2011 as a young 19-year-old A1C in the United States Air Force. This was long before the days of HackTheBox, popularity of various subreddits, and the availability of information as it is today. 

I was fresh out of technical training in Mississippi and had just recently moved to Okinawa, Japan at the time. Some days it seems like another lifetime ago, other days they feel like they were just occuring yesterday. My first time around in the labs I think I barely managed to pop 10 boxes in the labs - mostly with metasploit. These early days weren't entirely fruitless. As a matter of fact, I think these were some of the most dramatic learning periods in my life so far. Within the short span of 60 days in the labs, and with the guidance of muts talking in my ears, I felt like I had a better picture of the environments I was working on in real life. I felt like I could imagine, visually, what all tiers of the network looked like. I had an understanding of traffic flow, application interactions, and a new found love for programming that took me beyond what I thought I could achieve from my training. The course materials were not the problem. I simply was not prepared to take on OSCP at this point of my life; however, these early struggles started a fire within me to keep trying harder. A temporary assignment to Korea and a ~7 month deployment to the Middle East would postpone my time of getting back in the labs for another 2 years.

## 2013 - The Year Progress Was Made
The deployment ended with mostly quiet celebration. I hadn't seen my family in about 4 years at this point, and I was generally lost with what I wanted to do with my life. The military life (even as relatively relaxed as the Air Force can be) was starting to take its toll on me. I wasn't sure if I was going to stay in for the next 17 years, or if I was going to get out in another 3. I needed some additional direction with my life that the military just couldn't provide. Another temporary duty assignment to Busan, South Korea is where I would make the next dramatic leap in my skillset. I was living in this busted down, creepy looking, medical ward that was probably abandoned after the Korean War in the 1950's. It was here where my mad scientist labs started to come to life. Every day after work, I would go to the nearest wifi hotspot I could, grab as many images off of VulnHub as possible, and started getting to work.
+	De-ICE Series (This was good back in the day, but there are more relevant hosts you can try these days IMO. See here: [OSCP-Like VulnHub Machines](https://www.abatchy.com/2017/02/oscp-like-vulnhub-vms))
+	PwnOS 1.0 ([PwnOS1.0](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pwnos-10,33/))
+	IO wargame on smashthestack(dot)org ([IO Wargame](https://io.netgarage.org/))

These would be my labs to learn as much as I could before going back to the Offsec labs. I spent the next several months pounding my face against my keyboard trying to figure out these machines, and the lessons they could teach. I reviewed what was available from the PDF exercises to see if I could configure these machines in various ways: pivoting from one to another, mix-and-matching different bugs across the other machines, etc. I had taken the complexities of these boxes to the next level. October 2013 is when I finally returned to the PWB labs, and I bumped my box-count up to the mid 20's this time. I still wasn't sure if I had what it took to pass the exam, but I decided to try my hardest anyway.

## 2014 - Exam Attempt Number 1
I started it on a Friday night in February. Many people opt to start their exams during the morning hours to adapt with their lifestyle. I was not a morning person whatsoever. I operate best at nighttime. I stormed into that exam like a madman. I knocked out the buffer overflow machine in about ~3 hours, managed to the get the 10-point box a few hours after that, finished a 20-pointer, and got a low-privilege shell on one of the other boxes just as my exam time ran out. There was an opportunity to pass on this first attempt; however, I royally, and unequivocally, [explicatived] this attempt up. How did I do that? 

**I was not prepared for the reporting aspect of the exam, and I closed the low-privilege terminal without copying proof I had ever gotten it.**

This one mistake caused me to instantly realize I could have passed, but now was definitively not going to. I sent my follow-up e-mail to Offensive Security, admitted my defeat, and withdrew myself into, coincidentally, a very short-lasting depression. Within hours of having sent that e-mail, I received what was quite possibly one of, if not the most, life-changing responses from Offensive Security:

"Dear OS-6717, We're sorry to hear that. You may be disappointed in yourself now, but we here at Offensive Security have made a mistake or two once upon a time ;). The important thing now is to recognize where you need to try harder, and then try harder some more. We'll be seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Offensive Security"

This response in 2019 could have been taken in a multitude of different ways, and I'm certain they send generic responses these days; however, they were absolutely correct. It was at this time I realized what the whole course was even about. PWK isn't about becoming a master hacker. It's not about enumerating systems to the theoretical heat death of the universe. You could take all of the infosec-related material out of OSCP, and it would be one of the most powerful courses in resilience. It is about trying harder. It's about taking on that challenge - whatever it may be in your life - that's in front of you, right here and now. With this new outlook on where I was going, it was back to the labs for me.

## 2014-2016 - Build, Attack, Destroy, Repeat
These next few years would fine-tune my methodology, deepen my knowledge in systems and network administration and engineering, and "sharpen the ax" as old Abe Lincoln would say. The Air Force was kind enough to send me on a few week-long bootcamps that grew my knowledge in policy, DFIR, and blue team operations. I was stationed back in Japan, this time in Tokyo, and enjoying the journey that I was navigating for myself. Some poor life-choices would be made during this time, but I was still labbing it up - this time getting even more crazy, and more complex with the environments I was building. I signed up for a Microsoft TechNet account so I could mess around with various Windows images, signed up for Cisco Learning Network to mess around with networking device images, and GNS3 + Virtualbox to tie everything together. This time, I built environments that would be as close as I could make them to small-business networks within the very limited resources of my quad-core, 8GB of ram, laptop. These resources were absolutely critical to my development and understanding of IT in general:
+	GNS3 ([GNS3](https://gns3.com))
+	Microsoft TechNet ([Microsoft TechNet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/))
+	Cisco Learning Network ([Cisco Learning Network](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com))

With these resources, I built from the ground-up: domain environments, pivotable networks, access-control policies, and otherwise integrated system environments. I cannot stress enough how important it is that you try building an environment from scratch. I cannot even begin to describe how much value you will gain from the knowledge of setting up everything from routers & switches, to domain controllers, to Application & DB-tiered systems. This knowledge will take you beyond what any certification or college course can do for you. You will be self-reliant, you'll be able to engage in conversations with people of all IT disciplines, you'll have a deeper understanding of applications and programming, and you will be able to contribute significant value to yourself, your peers, your employer, and your employees. This was without a doubt, the 2nd biggest leap I made in understanding what I was doing both in my studies, and in my career. One environment I built was a small-scale, edge-network, tied in with a domain environment, that pivoted into a SCADA system (IGSS by Schneider Electric). How cool is that? SCADA on its own is a technology that I never would have experienced had I not built the environment myself (which also ended up becoming crucial knowledge to solving a long-unsolved security issue at my current place of employment in 2017)! Never be afraid to take on a new project - especially if you have to do all of the leg work on your own! I built, attacked, and destroyed these environments relentlessly during this time period. I cannot stress enough how important it is to be able to create. 2016 ended bittersweet for me. I decided to separate from the Air Force, and live my life on my own terms. There were a lot of things I liked about the military, but there were a lot of things I didn't. I was a civilian once again. I had maybe $1500 dollars to my name, and I spent $1000 of it on a very crappy Chevy C-10 Blazer. I was interviewing with my current employer as I was getting out, and the deal hadn't been totally signed off yet. However, I had to find a way from Wisconsin to Missouri to make it happen anyway. I spent several weeks fixing this piece of crap up with my best friend from my hometown - James. I remember telling him, "all I need this thing to do is make it to Missouri so I can start this job! How can we make that happen?" He smiled at me and said, "I hope you're ready to learn about cars, because there's too much wrong with it for me to fix it by myself." Learn I did. I packed what few things I had brought with me from Japan, threw them into the truck, and made my way toward a new life. In retrospect, I wish I had spent more time with James during these days.

## 2017-2018 - The Era Of Bugs
Unfortunately I cannot go into too much detail about this time period as of yet; however, my knowledge had continued to grow tremendously. I submitted a bug report to Cisco that resulted in CVE-2017-12301 being assigned - I discovered this at my place of employment, and as of this writing the exploit is still the company's intellectual property. I have not received explicit permission to disclose it, although future circumstances may change this - they also may not. I would continue to discover three more bugs in Arista EOS: however, Arista did not feel the bug reports warranted CVE's, so they opted to quietly patch. This may bring up another blog at a later time about vendor/researcher relations and how you - the researcher - should be prepared to interact with a vendor. Anyway, I finally got some bugs under my belt at this point, and I was sure I could tackle OSCP the next time I was able to jump into the labs. Unfortunately, life circumstances struck again. This time it would be an onslaught of penetration test spin-ups, PCI audits, and the like. 

## 2019 - OSCP
After proving myself at work, I asked my boss if I could get the company to sponsor my OSCP. I remember telling him right off the bat, "I know this cert has a reputation for being difficult, but I can GUARANTEE I will pass." My work ethic and accolades to this point seem to have paid off, because I was given the green light (many thanks to all of you Josh, Keith, and Ryan!). Working by day, hacking by night, I was crushing absolutely everything. I had pwned every single host, in all of the networks, by day 35 of the 60 day lab time. This was it. I knew, no matter what the circumstances were, I had the confidence to tackle the exam. I spent the rest of my lab time building out bookmarks for the gotmilk and fuzzysecurity blogs, some various cheat sheets for enumeration, and made sure my own tool revshellgen were on a **fresh instance of the PWK student Kali image - and I never touched it again until the exam.** In addition to this, I spent the next several weeks (and still to this day), sharing hints on every host in the lab in a manner that other students could form their own attack plan off of. My hints were...mix-received. Half of the students hated them, the other half loved them. Either way, helping other students learn was another big step in my learning process as it kept the knowledge fresh between the end of my lab time, and up to my exam. 

Once again, I started my exam on a Friday night. I wanted to be absolutely sure that I was in the exact same mental state I normally would be if I were in the labs. Within several hours I had conquered root on three hosts. I took a few 10-15 minute breaks here and there, but all-in-all I went at the exam non-stop. I'm certain I probably dropped my proctor's jaw as I was about ~3 beers in and still crushing the exam thus far. I got a little hungry around 5AM, looking over all of the info I had collected on host #4 and grabbed a banana. I highly recommend you take in something with more sustenance than beers and a banana, but it worked for me. I knew exactly what I had to do on the final host, and popped root on it a few hours later. After celebrating wildly knewing I had enough points to pass, I took one last look at the last exam host. I didn't want to just cut it short, but I was getting nowhere with it. Remembering the various pentest reports I had seen at work, I ended up documenting some concerning issues that I had discovered, and left it at that - as that is what real pentesters do on their reports if they cannot find the easy wins. There are always issues to be found at various levels of severity, and they are worth documenting. 

Anyway, that's it. That's all I've got to say. There are plenty of other resources that will suit some students better for their learning goals than hearing my life story. I've had a lot of time to think about what the most important tool is for taking on this course. I can say, without a doubt, the most crucial skill you could ever need to pass OSCP is perseverance. The important thing now is to recognize where you need to try harder, and then try harder some more. I'll be seeing you again soon.
